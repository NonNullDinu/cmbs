//! A work in progress meta build system for C/C++ projects written in Rust.
//!
//! Primary values:
//! - Speed. The Compile part in the Edit-Compile-Run cycle should
//!  take as little as possible.
//!
//! - Compatibility with popular build systems out there.
//!  There is a lot of C/C++ code out there, and your code may
//!  have dependencies that use other build systems. In such
//!  cases, `leafbuild` should try to make sure they will work together.
//!
//! - Keep the syntax as simple as *reasonable*, but don't take the simplicity
//!  part too far(see meson, golang).
//!
//! # Contributions
//! See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/leafbuild/leafbuild/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
//!
//! # MSRV policy
//! This will always work with the latest stable toolchain, though it may compile with older
//! versions.
